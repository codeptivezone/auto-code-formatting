# auto-code-formatting
This project automates code formatting with Prettier and JS-Beautify, ensuring consistency across the codebase. Husky enforces formatting on Git pre-commit hooks, reducing manual effort and whitespace issues in pull requests. It ensures uniform code styling for all developers, even if they haven't installed the formatting tools locally. ðŸš€
